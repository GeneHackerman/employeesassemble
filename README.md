  ## Description
  An employee team generator using node.js along with inquirer and jest. Upon filling out the prompted questions, cards will be generated to an HTML page detailing the employee name, ID, email, school and GitHub username. 

  ## Installation
  Clone the repository via github.com and then at the command line in GITbash, type npm install and then npm install inquirer(this will install the necessary packages to run the program). Remember to copy and paste the files from the cloned repository folder to your own as it will return a permission denied message. Node index at the command line will prompt the questions. Answer each question and your cards will be populated with data on the HTML page generated.  

  ## Usage
  Run node index at the command line and fill out the prompted questions to generate the full HTML file(located in the dist folder) with categorized cards.
